Hello Today,


I Finished my Rails portfolio Project. I must admit after completing this task I can see this being molded into something fun and practical for people manly gamers. At first I was going to redo my Sinatra project and just be done with a simple task and idea, but then I realized I would be selling myself short. So while listening to one of my favorite podcast a thought came over me. I  notice that when it comes to video games there is a sale almost everyday if not every week. These sales are nothing to laugh at either ranges from 30% to 80%. So when I see a good sale I take the opportunity to buy it. This also creates a problem, as these games go on sale and people buy them there are also new games releasing at the same time. As the average consumer would want to buy the new shiny thing because people are talking about it and they don't want to be left out of the conversation right. What do you think happen to the 12 games they just bought on sale for the low price of $30? Either started and never completed or never touched and forgotten. Now an average person (myself included) have a backlog of games that just we can't keep track of across multiple platforms. Then again what if we can keep track of them, or log all the games a person currently own and keep track of the progress they mad for each one? That's the concept that my project stems from. As i dwell on this idea I then realized that I had to stop dreaming about it and actually do. Although it not as I envision it to be(yet) but this set up the foundation for what I want to do for my last 3 portfolio project in flatiron. So here we are Part 1 of 3 of this personal project name Task Force.


****Now with Introductions out of the way WHAT IS THE MAIN FUNCTION OF THE APPLICATION?****



With Task Force has one simple(kinda) function. Log a user game library and make note of their progression within that game. The logging part was easy. Every game belonged to a user and every game had a title genre and the platform that user is playing on. After creating forms for a user to put this information in then tricky part of the app is to also log their progression. Mostly in percentage since it simple and most games do record your progression in percentages. I added a simple progress bar that is connected to the percentage that the user put in and displays it.

**What Else?**

I also added  authentication through facebook. User can sign in with facebook and access their session that is saved.
In the future I would like to integrate some Javascript. I also would like to implement a feature that would access accounts of users that use other platforms like steam or PSN and pull up a library of games that belong to them and log their progress and accolades.

Hopefully down the line I can add this but for now i believe this is a good foundation and a template for other ideas if it comes to mind.
